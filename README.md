# Datasift CSDL Samples Library

This repository acts as a library of definitions to help developers work with the Datasift platform.

The definitions in the library can be saved as a Stream by logging into your Datasift dashboard. Or, they can be compiled via the CSDL REST API. 

For documentation on the Datasift platform, please see [http://dev.datasift.com/docs](http://dev.datasift.com/docs)

## Tagging Definitions

The CSDL definitions within the tagging folder are reusable taxonomies for tagging interactions. There are useful reusable definitions which you may choose to copy and use, or you may choose to use these definitions as templates that you customise for your application.
